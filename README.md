### Personal Project!

- feels huge in scope
- googleoauth, iffy, easier to do basic authentication/login form maybe....
- make users, linked to porfolios, quantity of stocks, 
- django will talk to db
- scrape data from twitter, reddit, finance forums
- use llm, model to analyze said data, form sentiment score
- use API calls to provide porfolio analysis
- allow users to add, sell, change amounts of stock owned.
- right bar displays quick access to several news sources: hackernews, wall street journal, tldr, also find a way to pull hot topics?? Word on the street, recent hot news section vs. important news. three sections of: first, Important, huge headlines, scrape real time hot news, and pull/have links to my trusted sources.
- IPO calendar option too?
-finbert vs finnhub
-charts.js

To Do: 
Setup vercel + heroku conversation, basic homepage, perhaps auth capabilities + login. Database switching depending on local dev or deployment, maybe CI/CD too(tommorrow problem)..
7/30

07/29 morning: Heroku deployment setup properly, allowed hosts configured, now can setup views, create database schema.
# Possible Roadmap (Changes possible)
Day 1-2: Project Setup + Auth System
âœ… Set up your project structure:

Backend (e.g., Django, Flask, FastAPI)

Frontend (React or another JS framework)

PostgreSQL or SQLite for dev

âœ… Set up user authentication (JWT or session-based)

Registration/Login/Logout

User model with email/password

âœ… Use environment variables for secrets (e.g., .env)

Day 3-4: Stock Data Ingestion
âœ… Choose a stock data source (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub)

Build utility functions or a service module to query stock prices, company info, etc.

âœ… Implement a scheduler (e.g., Celery + Redis, or cron job) for periodic updates

âœ… Store stock data in your database:

Tickers, historical prices, meta info

Day 5: Database Models & APIs
âœ… Models:

Stock: Ticker, name, etc.

StockPrice: Date, Open, Close, Volume

UserStock: FK to user + FK to stock, quantity, buy price

âœ… Build APIs:

Get all available stocks

Get details for a single stock

Add/remove a stock to a user's portfolio

Day 6-7: Portfolio API & Frontend Scaffolding
âœ… API:

Get user's current portfolio (with current vs buy prices)

Compute metrics (e.g., total value, gains/losses, diversification)

âœ… Start frontend with authentication and protected routes

Use JWT/localStorage

Basic dashboard: List stocks, view details, add to portfolio

ðŸ—“ Week 2 â€“ Portfolio Analysis, UI, and Polish
Day 8-9: Portfolio Analysis Features
âœ… Calculate metrics:

% returns, average return, risk (std dev), diversification

Use pandas or numpy if needed

âœ… Chart data:

Line charts for price history

Pie chart for portfolio allocation

Day 10-11: Frontend Display
âœ… Build portfolio dashboard:

Show each stock's info

Gain/loss per stock and overall

Charts using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts

âœ… Add filters/search for stocks

Day 12: Error Handling & Testing
âœ… Handle common errors (e.g., API limits, invalid tickers)

âœ… Write unit tests for backend logic

âœ… Test auth and edge cases (unauthorized access, bad inputs)

Day 13: Deployment Prep
âœ… Dockerize backend

âœ… Set up .env, production database configs

âœ… Deploy to Render, Railway, or Heroku (or your preferred host)

âœ… Optional: CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Day 14: Final Polish
âœ… UI polish (dark mode, loading states, responsive)

âœ… README with setup instructions

âœ… Short demo video/gif if showcasing
