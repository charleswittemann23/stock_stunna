### Personal Project!

- feels huge in scope
- googleoauth, iffy, easier to do basic authentication/login form maybe....
- make users, linked to porfolios, quantity of stocks, 
- django will talk to db
- scrape data from twitter, reddit, finance forums
- use llm, model to analyze said data, form sentiment score
- use API calls to provide porfolio analysis
- allow users to add, sell, change amounts of stock owned.
- right bar displays quick access to several news sources: hackernews, wall street journal, tldr, also find a way to pull hot topics?? Word on the street, recent hot news section vs. important news. three sections of: first, Important, huge headlines, scrape real time hot news, and pull/have links to my trusted sources.
- IPO calendar option too?
-finbert vs finnhub


To Do: 
Setup vercel + heroku conversation, basic homepage, perhaps auth capabilities + login. Database switching depending on local dev or deployment, maybe CI/CD too(tommorrow problem)

07/29 morning: Heroku deployment setup properly, allowed hosts configured, now can setup views, create database schema
